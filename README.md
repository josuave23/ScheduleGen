# ScheduleGen
### Functional

A passion project I am working on to help people manage their time better. 

This will be able to take an input of tasks from the user and create a balanced schedule of when a user should do their tasks

### Current Step: First Iteration

## To Do:
### Short term
- Debug the current iteration
- Optimize current code
- Add Canvas and Google calendar API
  - Code created, just need to implement it back in
### Long term
- Implement a calandar program for this to run on
- create a GUI for user accessability
